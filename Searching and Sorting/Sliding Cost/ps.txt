You are given an array of 
�
n integers. Your task is to calculate for each window of 
�
k elements, from left to right, the minimum total cost of making all elements equal.

You can increase or decrease each element with cost 
�
x where 
�
x is the difference between the new and the original value. The total cost is the sum of such costs.

Input
The first input line contains two integers 
�
n and 
�
k: the number of elements and the size of the window.

Then there are 
�
n integers
