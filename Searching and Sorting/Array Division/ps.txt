You are given an array containing 
�
n positive integers.

Your task is to divide the array into 
�
k subarrays so that the maximum sum in a subarray is as small as possible.

Input
The first input line contains two integers 
�
n and 
�
k: the size of the array and the number of subarrays in the division.

The next line contains 
�
n integers
