Time limit: 1.00 s Memory limit: 512 MB
Consider a money system consisting of 
�
n coins. Each coin has a positive integer value. Your task is to produce a sum of money 
�
x using the available coins in such a way that the number of coins is minimal.

For example, if the coins are 
{
1
,
5
,
7
}
{1,5,7} and the desired sum is 
11
11, an optimal solution is 
5
+
5
+
1
5+5+1 which requires 
3
3 coins.

Input
The first input line has two integers 
�
n and 
�
x: the number of coins and the desired sum of money.

The second line has 
�
n distinct integers 
�
1
,
�
2
,
…
,

n
​
 : the value of each coin.

Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of coins. If it is not possible to produce the desired sum, print 
−
1
−1.
