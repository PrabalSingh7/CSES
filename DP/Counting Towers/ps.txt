TASK SUBMIT RESULTS STATISTICS HACKING
Time limit: 1.00 s Memory limit: 512 MB
Your task is to build a tower whose width is 
2
2 and height is 
�
n. You have an unlimited supply of blocks whose width and height are integers.

For example, here are some possible solutions for 
�
=
6
n=6:


Given 
�
n, how many different towers can you build? Mirrored and rotated towers are counted separately if they look different.
Input
The first input line contains an integer 
�
t: the number of tests.

After this, there are 
�
t lines, and each line contains an integer 
�
n: the height of the tower.

Output
For each test, print the number of towers modulo 
1
