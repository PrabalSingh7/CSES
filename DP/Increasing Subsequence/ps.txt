You are given an array containing 
�
n integers. Your task is to determine the longest increasing subsequence in the array, i.e., the longest subsequence where every element is larger than the previous one.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Input
The first line contains an integer 
�
n: the size of the array.

After this there are 
�
n integers

Output
Print the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
