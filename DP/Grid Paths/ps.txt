Consider an 
�
×
�
n×n grid whose squares may have traps. It is not allowed to move to a square with a trap.

Your task is to calculate the number of paths from the upper-left square to the lower-right square. You can only move right or down.

Input
The first input line has an integer 
�
n: the size of the grid.

After this, there are 
�
n lines that describe the grid. Each line has 
�
n characters: . denotes an empty cell, and * denotes a trap.

Output
Print the number of paths modulo
